      Notes
      internal system - nothing outside of 1s and 0s,

      cooking recipes - designed to tell a machine how to do something (usually incredibly complex)
       - typically top to bottom

      - explanation of demoscene
        - highly complex visual graphics (4k, 4096 bytes, 64kb)
        - Really complicated things can be encoded in what are small units of transmission
        - Generally the limitations for encoding are beyond limits of human comprehension (huffman, binary)

      Human Meaning
        - Number of programmers
          - That's about 0.004% of world's adult population (15-64)
          - 18.5 million people, 42% of these are hobbyists
          - Generally programming languages looking anything like english is for our convenience
          - Functional Programming, which elements side effects by representing all calculations as the product of functions (is insane)
        - Much of what we consider "pure programming" is dreadfully difficult for humans to understand (Functional Programming, Haskel, Monads)

      Only Source
        - Computers only create meaning through code

      Natural
      - Homo sapien 150-200k years (About )
      - Proto-language perhaps with Homo Habilis (1.5-2.8 million years ago)

      - Only source for meaning
        - thinking requires language)
      - Actual encoding of meaning is chemical
      - What do i mean by "abstraction" (hidden units of calculation)

    <h3>&mdash;Conditions of&mdash;</h3>
    <h2>Natural Languages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Approx (200,000 ?) years of history</li>
      <li>Poor at representing abstraction (logic)
        <ul>
          <li>What is love?</li>
          <li>How do you tie a shoe?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Great at describing physical arrangement (more later)</li>
      <li>The only source for <b>conveying meaning</b> for humans</li>

      Nouns - What is a horse?
        - One legged horse is still a horse
        - Dead horse
      Plurality - all three men are tall
      Modifiers - Tallness (although an abstraction) is still understood as a separate concept, although it specifically has no meaning (small ant, small planet)
      Context - Preposition "in" divides a sentence, related words generally share sentence position
    !-->
    <h3>&mdash;Benefits of&mdash;</h3>
    <h2>Natural Languages</h2>
    <li>Describe physicality <b>incredibly well</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Three tall men in a room
          <ul>
            <li>Nouns (Prototype)</li>
            <li>Modifiers (Refinements/Adjustments from Prototype)</li>
            <li>Plurality (Simplified conceptual replication)</li>
            <li>Context (Additional Emphasis / Conceptual De-cluttering)</li>
            <li>Encoding length 6 words!
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Words are designed to optimize encoding of meaning given our "bandwidth" (working memory)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Removes unnecessary detail. "Three tall legs attached to torsos attached to heads"</li>
            <li>Provide "optimal working units" for humans, "wordsmithing" (iceberg)</li>
            <li>Word order and sentence position matters, words have meaning <em>in context</em></li>
            <li>Removes unnecessary detail. "Three tall legs attached to torsos attached to heads"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Are selected for conceptual precision
          <ul>
            <li>We can speak about 160 words per minute</li>
            <li>Too many words and we can be really precise, but it would take forever</li>
            <li>Too few we risk being misunderstood</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Designed for representing <b>constantly evolving external systems</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Determined by <b>ecological validity</b>. Words are removed, added as they need to be to cover changes in environment</li>
            <li>Evolves collectively through changes in usage / adoption</li>
            <li>Provide "optimal working units" for humans, "wordsmithing" (iceberg)</li>
            <li>Word order and sentence position matters, words have meaning <em>in context</em></li>
            <li>Are selected for terseness (we can speak about 160 words per minute)</li>
        </li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Encoding meaning through natural language is like looking 200k years into the future of conceptual encoding</li>

  <div class="slide">
    <h3>&mdash;How Does This Matter&mdash;</h3>
    <h2>Coding Takeaways</h2>
    <li>Exchange languages are selected for under the same constraints as language (vocal cords = baud modems)</li>
    <li>NL Words evolve to be the most salient representation of concepts for humans. </li>
    <li>Markup class names oddly resemble words in terms of descriptive function</li>
    <li>FE class names should use basic NL words to encode meaning</li>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h3>&mdash;Web Components&mdash;</h3>
    <h2>Web Nouns</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Let's say you don't agree with any of the parallels.</li>
      <li>We can at least agree that the web is made up of smaller 'conceptual units of physicality'</li>
      <li>AKA UI Components</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h2>Design at Scale</h2>
    <h3>Empire State Building</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How long to build? <b class="bullet">2 years, 3,400 workers</b></li>
      <li>How long to design? <b class="bullet">2 weeks, 1 guy (William F. Lamb)</b></li>
      <li>Most of the man-hours in creating large structures is just building the damn thing</li>
      <li>Production is <b>technical work</b> but "all the pieces should be there already".</li>
    </ul>
